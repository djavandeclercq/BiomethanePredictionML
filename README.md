Interpretable machine for industrial-scale biomethane prediction

Abstract

The objective of this study is to apply machine learning models to accurately predict biomethane in an industrial-scale co-digestion facility. The methodology involved applying elasticnet, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting to input-output data from an industrial-scale anaerobic co-digestion (ACoD) facility.The models were used to predict biomethane for 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 40-day time horizons. These models were fit on four years of operational data. The results showed that elastic net (a model with assumptions of linearity) was clearly outperformed by random forest and XGBoost, which had out-of-sample R2 values ranging between 0.80 to 0.88, depending on the time horizon. In addition, feature importance and partial dependence analysis demonstrated the marginal and interaction effects on biomethane of selected biowaste inputs. The implication of this study is that interpretable machine learning can provide excellent insight into anaerobic digestion process dynamics for industrial-scale ACoD project operators, especially when used in conjunction with experimental and mechanistic/theoretical models of anaerobic digestion. 

Highlights

•	Elastic net, random forest, and XGBoost were applied to industrial-scale biomethane prediction. 
•	Predictions were made over 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40-day time horizons to evaluate robustness.
•	Depending on the time horizon, out-of-sample R2 values of up to 0.88 were achieved. 
•	Feature importance and partial dependence were used to interpret these machine models. 
•	Machine learning models can be a useful supplement to experimental and mechanistic models of AD.

Keywords
